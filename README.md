# Forumactif Toolbar Alias

The purpose of this script is to redefine the language content of the toolbar. For example change "Welcome" to "Logged in as." The script can be installed via **Modules > JavaScript Codes Management > New script**, the placement should of course be in all the pages.

A more indepth tutorial will be created *soon*.
